# Crack Of Moon Animator 2
Moon Animator is simply the best animation plugin currently on the platform. It's highly versatile, some of the benefits you have over the Roblox animation editor are: mirroring animations (makes walk cycles consistent), onion skinning/ghost frames, a large variety of easing options--some configurable too, highly supportive community + tutorials.
